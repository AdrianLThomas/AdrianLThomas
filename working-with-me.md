# Working with me

## What I'm good at
- Organised, I have to-do lists for everything
- Reliable, if we agree something, it will be on my to-do list and I'll prioritise accordingly
- Diligence
- Looking through the eyes of the user (UX, DX, etc.)
- I'll speak up if I have a strong opinion for/against, if I'm quiet I'm probably in agreement

## What I'm not good at
- Multitasking, if I'm in a meeting you will likely have my full attention, but I'm probably not writing code or making detailed notes either

## How to work with me
- Feel free to be direct
- If you have feedback for me, please do it in private and be constructive so I can improve (in person or written is fine)
- When starting something new, I like to read through any material first
- I find pairing productive yet exhausting, a balance works best for me
- I like async working, but feel free if you want to chit-chat too.
